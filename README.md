# ✂️ Barber Shop System

> 🚧 **Work in Progress**  
> This project is currently under active development and may change frequently.

A barbershop management system developed with **Laravel 12**, using **Laravel Fortify** for authentication and **Blade** as the templating engine.

📱 **Mobile First Approach**  
The interface is being designed primarily for mobile devices.  
Because of that, the desktop version may currently look unpolished or visually inconsistent.  
A dedicated responsive layout for larger screens is planned for future updates.

The application runs in a fully **Dockerized environment**, ensuring easy setup and consistent execution across different machines.

cd barber-shop-system
```

### 2. Build and start the containers

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Wait until the build process finishes.

### 3. Install dependencies and configure the application

Run the following commands in order:

```bash
docker compose exec app composer install
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed
```

### 4. Access the application

After completing the steps above, the application will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

And the Mailpit at:

```bash
http://localhost:8025
```

## Notes

Environment variables are managed through the .env file.
If needed, copy the example file:

Authentication is handled by Laravel Fortify, without using front-end frameworks such as Vue or React.
The UI is built using Blade + HTML + CSS only, with no external UI libraries.
